I'm Byron, an Infrastructure Engineer based in the Bay Area with over 15 years of
experience building and automating scalable systems. I specialize in cloud infrastructure
(GCP/AWS), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and creating solutions that eliminate
manual processes.

After spending nearly a decade in San Francisco where I cut my teeth in tech and met my
wife, we've settled in the East Bay where I'm now navigating the adventures of raising a
toddler who never stops running and a baby boy. When I'm not wrangling infrastructure or
kids, you'll find me on my mountain bike tackling the trails at Brionesâ€”Spengler up,
Hank and Frank down is my go-to lunch ride. Though my heart belongs to the epic trails of
Squamish, BC.

I'm passionate about building systems that scale, whether that's enterprise
infrastructure or finding the best food spots around the Bay. Yes, I've been to Burning
Man, and yes, it was exactly as transformative and dusty as you'd imagine.

Feel free to reach out at byron@sftechguy.com if you want to chat about tech, trails, or
anything in between.
