## Extra Curricular Activities
When not working I enjoy staying active and healthy. I also keep adding to my home IT systems. My home environment includes a NAS, Ubiquity UniFi Access Points and a XBMC media center. Other non-technical activities include running, cycling, climbing, camping, and spending time with friends and family.
